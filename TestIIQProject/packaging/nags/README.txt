NetIQ Access Governance Suite
-----------------------------

Use the install.sh, install.bat, or install.jar files to extract the
NetIQ Access Governance Suite installation files.  A Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) or Development Kit (JDK) is required.  If install.sh
or install.bat is used, the java command must be in the PATH.  If
install.jar is used, the operating system must be configured with a
launch handler for .jar files.

The installation location specified in the installation wizard is where
the files will be extracted and not the final installation destination
for the product.

Once extracted, refer to the Release Notes and Installation Guide
located in the extracted doc directory for further details on installing
and configuring the product in your environment.
