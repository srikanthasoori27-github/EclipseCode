#Role Mining
help_mining_max_training=Maximum number of identities to analyze.  It is not always necessary to analyze every identity to determine a useful set of roles.  Setting this may improve mining performance.  If not specified, all identities within the search filter will be analyzed.

help_mining_max_clusters=Maximum number of role clusters to identity.  If value is less than zero we attempt to determine the optimal number through cross-validation.
help_mining_min_deviation=The minimum standard deviation when calculating normal density.  Reducing this value can help prevent arithmetic overflow resulting from multiplying large densities (arising from small standard deviations) when there are many singleton or near singleton values.  Default is 1e-6f.

The 'Manager' setting is where the user's manager will be required to approve and 'SecurityOfficer' which is where the identity named in the variable securityOfficerName will be required to approve. In some cases for IdentityIQ changes there may be a manager change, so there is also an option named "New Manager" where the newly assigned manager will get approval. Which options are available will depend on the workflow being edited.
help_wf_provisioning_approval_disable=Select this option to disable all approvals.
help_wf_provisioning_policy_scheme=Select a value that specifies how policy checks effect the overall workflow process.
