  This is an alternative to SailPointObject.hbm.xml for "child"
  objects.  It avoids the assignedScope and assignedScopePath
  columns (and their related indexes) for objects that don't have
  a scope distinct from their parent object.

  We could probably dispense with the created and modified fields
  too but at least thost aren't indexed.

  Keeping owner just because the most obvious use is for things
  that hang off an Identity but that cold be factored out if we
  find the need for something like this other classes.

  In retrospect we should have used this for Scorecard, IdentityHistory
  and maybe Link.
