  Note that since we create composite indexes on all three of these values
  you have to arrange for the total size not to exceed 450 for SQL Server.
  With the usual sizes of 128 for object ids and names that leaves
  only 194 characters for the value.  

  Hibernate ids are only 32 characters and a 128 character attribute
  name feels too long.  So dropping both of those to 64 to transfer 
  some space

    <property name="objectId" type="string" length="64"/>
    <property name="attributeName" type="string" length="64"/>
    <property name="value" type="string" length="322"/>
