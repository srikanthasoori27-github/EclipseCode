      Note that while in Java we are a SailPointObject subclass
      we don't include SailPointObject.hbm.xml because we don't need
      all the extra columns.  So we can modify these programatically
      it's easier to give then a non-generated unique key.  Alternately
      we could try to enforce that there be only one of these in the table
      but reserving a name is easier.
