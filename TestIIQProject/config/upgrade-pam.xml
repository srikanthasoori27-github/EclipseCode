  This is used by 'iiq upgrade' to drive upgrading the schema and data between revisions.
  There are two files that define the upgrade: upgrade.xml and upgradeObjects.xml. If you have PAM enabled, there are
  an additional two files upgrade-pam.xml and upgradeObjects-pam.xml.
  upgrade.xml and upgrade-lcm.xml are processed in a special way before Hibernate is started so that changes can be
  made at the JDBC level. These files should only contain <ImportAction> elements that use the "execute" command to
  call upgrader classes.
  *DO NOT PUT STATIC XML OBJECTS IN UPGRADE.XML OR UPGRADE-PAM.XML*
  upgradeObjects.xml and upgradeObjects-pam.xml are included by upgrade.xml and upgrade-pam.xml respectively; they will
  be imported after Hibernate is started. Any changes to objects that can be represented as static XML or as
  ImportActions with the "merge" command must go in these files to ensure that they are parsed after Hibernate has been
  started so that references can be resolved. Like upgrade.xml, each action should have a revision attribute specified,
  which will be checked while upgrading to make sure that upgrades aren't run multiple times. First the upgraders that
  are marked as pre-Hibernate are run, then Hibernate is started, then the ones marked as post-Hibernate are run. After
  all the upgraders are run and Hibernate is started, the upgradeObjects-pam.xml file is imported.
