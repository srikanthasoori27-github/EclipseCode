  This is used by 'iiq upgrade' to drive upgrading the schema and data between revisions.
  There are two files that define the upgrade: upgrade.xml and upgradeObjects.xml. If you have Rapid Setup enabled,
  there are an additional two files, upgrade-rapidsetup.xml and upgradeObjects-rapidsetup.xml.
  upgrade.xml and upgrade-rapidsetup.xml are processed in a special way before Hibernate is started so that changes can
  be made at the JDBC level. These files should only contain <ImportAction> elements that use the "execute" command to
  call upgrader classes.
  *DO NOT PUT STATIC XML OBJECTS IN UPGRADE.XML OR UPGRADE-RAPIDSETUP.XML*
  upgradeObjects-rapidsetup.xml is included by upgrade-rapidsetup.xml and will be imported after Hibernate is started.
  Any changes to objects that can be represented as static XML or as ImportActions with the "merge" command must go in
  these files to ensure that they are parsed after Hibernate has been started so that references can be resolved.
