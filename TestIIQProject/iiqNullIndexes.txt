#
# This file is ready by SailPointSchemaGenerator and is used to declare
# which indexes on Oracle should use a special form of concatenated index
# that allows indexing columns with null values.  Oracle does not normally
# include null values in an index.  For some queries on columns that can
# can be null this results in table scans.  This can be avoided by defining
# the index in this way:
#  
#    create index foo on some_table (some_column, ' ');
#
# The inclusion of the space in the index causes the indexed value
# to always be non-null.  This technique is being selectively enabled
# on certain high volume classes.  If you are experiencing performance
# problems in other classes you can add them here and regenerate the
# DDL scripts, or alter the index.
#
# The file contains lines of the form:
#
#    <className>,<propertyName>
#
# Where <classname> is the sailpoint.object class without package
# prefix and without ".class", for example "Identity".  
#
# <propertyName> must be the camel cased property name,
# for example "assignedScopePath".
#

Identity,assignedScopePath
ManagedAttribute,assignedScopePath
