  <p>Review Owners,</p>
<p>In response to General IT Controls (GITC) for ”Review of User Access”, the review of access to GEAC for your direct reports starts on $dayReviewBegins $reviewBeginDate. </p>
<p>Element managers are responsible for ensuring that only authorized individuals have appropriate access to our key financial reporting applications. User access reviews are performed quarterly. These reviews help safeguard Element's assets and financial reporting data and support the CEO/CFO controls certification. </p>
 <p>User Review Completion Process </p>
<p>Take the following steps to complete the review:</p>
<p><table border="2">
<th align="center">Step</th>
<th aligh="left">Action</th>
<tr><td align="center">1</td><td aligh="left">Log in to the $applicationName</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">2</td><td aligh="left">Locate your name</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">3</td><td aligh="left">Review your listed direct reports and their access to GEAC on columns 1 to 4 </td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">4</td><td aligh="left">Click on the “SAVE” icon to save your responses </td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<p>This round of reviews must be completed no later than $dayReviewEnds $reviewEndDate EOD. </p>
<p>Review Owners Responsibility </p>
<ul>
<li>It is the manager’s responsibility to review system access for each direct report. </li>

<li>If response or confirmation is not completed by $dayReviewEnds $reviewEndDate  then your direct manager will receive notification that the target date was missed, and responsibility will shift to your direct manager. <lo>

<li>If no response is received by $dayReviewEnds $reviewEndDate  then the GEAC mainframe access for the identified users will be disabled. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here is our standard review schedule: </p>
